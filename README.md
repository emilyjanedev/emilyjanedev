# Hi there, I'm Emily 👋
I am a Full-Stack Developer that is endlessly curious and eager to learn. I love getting into the nitty-gritty details of a project to figure out what is going wrong, or how things can be done better. I love coming across new problems and challenges, because that means I'll come out of it with new skills and a deeper understanding.

## About Me 💁🏻‍♀️
- 🎓 I recently completed my Diploma in Software Engineering
- 🔭 I’m currently working on WhiskerWatch, a platform dedicated to reuniting lost pets with their owners
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- 🖥️ I grew up building computers with my Dad, which sparked my passion for tech from a young age

## What's Next
- After completing my Software Engineering Diploma at BrainStation, I was invited back and offered a position as a Teaching Assistant for the next Software Engineering cohort. Currently, I am supporting and empowering these future developers on their journey of breaking into tech! After this, I hope to move into a full-time Software Developer role at a Vancouver tech company. If you're reading this and think I'd be a good fit at your company, please reach out! I would love to learn more about what you are working on.
