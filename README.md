# Hi there, I'm Emily 👋
I am a Full-Stack Developer that is endlessly curious and eager to learn. I love getting into the nitty-gritty details of a project to figure out what is going wrong, or how things can be done better. I love coming across new problems and challenges, because that means I'll come out of it with new skills and a deeper understanding.

## About Me 💁🏻‍♀️
- 🎓 I'm a recent graduate from the Brainstation Software Engineering Bootcamp
- 🔭 I’m currently working on WhiskerWatch, a platform dedicated to reuniting lost pets with their owners.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- 🖥️ I grew up building computers with my Dad, which sparked my passion for tech from a young age.
